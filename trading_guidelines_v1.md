# 1: Edge: What is an edge?
	It's a competitive advantage we have that makes us win consistently (gives us +EV)​
	Most of the time it is something you have that other people do not have​
	Traditional forms of edge include​
		Speed of execution​
		Unique Flow​
		Opaque Market​
		Cost efficiency​

# 1: Edge: Why do some "retail traders" consistently make money?	
	Retail traders read news, look at chart, have access to normal software and info.
	They have no apparent edge that we can quantify. 
	Why do they consistently make money, with low drawdown a.k.a stable PNL?
	Is it survivor bias?​

# 1: Edge: Do we need it?
    Do we really need an edge to be consistently profitable?
    In a hawker centre / night market there are so many stores selling the same thing., e.g. coffee
    Most of them are exactly the same, yet they all make money even though its a zero-sum game too.
    This is an example of perfect competition and normal profits (economic profit = 0)
    They just make a consistent "small amount" they are not trying to be starbucks or coffee bean.
    *Economic Profit = Actual Accouning Cost - Opportunity Cost

# 1: Edge: How is trading similar / different?
    Contrary to popular belief, the formula to win in trading is out there on the internet / in books.
    The belief that "If it works people would trade it, and it will not work anymore" is not entirely true.​
    This is because most people do not believe in it enough / have discipline / the character to execute properly.
    Think about losing weight, how to lose weight is very clear, but many people can't execute it or try find shortcuts.
    Losing weight is not a zero sum game. So let's find another example.

# 1: Edge: Have we won in a zero-sum game without edge before?
    We all have won in zero-sum games when we have no edge, the closest example is studying in school.
    In school, the introduction classes such as Accounting 101, Calculus etc 
        - There are large number of students
        - Its graded on bell curve, and only X people can get A, Y people can get B etc
        - To a large extent, the formula to suceed is out there. Go to every lecture, revise everyday, read notes, consult teacher.
        - We are not trying to get A+ also, just a A, B or even a pass would suffice.
    Why did we suceed and manage to "beat" other people?
        - We are definitely better than the people we beat. 
        - But better here does not mean smarter, or access to more resources.
        - It means we are more hardworking, more discipline in studying etc
        - We put in more effort than other people, we want it enough to sacrifice sleep etc

# 1: Edge: Character / Personality
	The variance in intelligence is not huge. Few are much smarter or stupider. 
	The variance in character is​ huge. People have many different personality traits etc. 
    Hence, traits such as consistent hardwork, patience, discipline, humility etc are important​.
        - Many people do not consistently research, but we do.
        - Many people do not patiently wait for a signal, but we do.
        - Many people buy and sell based on whether they like a company, but we do not etc 

# 1: Edge: Conclusion
    We are not trying to be a gold medalist, be a valedictorian a.k.a be Bridgewaters / Virtu / Rentech
    We are just trying to earn normal profits, which can be sizable (50k-100k USD / day). This is because
        - We are willing to sacrifice our time, effort, we give up drinking, going out etc.
        - We pay with opportunity cost. (which is why its normal profits)
        - Markets that do no give us edge are often very liquid and scalable, we can trade in size
        - There will always be events that cause people to be emotional, panic / greedy and anyhow trade.
        - As long as we are not these people, we can earn their money. 
        - Its times like this we earn more than normal profits.
    Most important takeaway: Even without insider info, good hardware, we can still make it if we want it enough


# 2: Staying Positive: Review our trades​
    Review all our trades and recall why we enter it, why we exit it
    If we are winning, find out what we are doing right so we can keep doing it. That's how we become consistently profitable
    If we are losing, find out why we are losing and make changes​. That's how we improve
    The most stupid thing is we win because of randomness, but we are so happy like a idiot.

# 2: Staying Positive: Be memoryless​
    Don't trade based on your entry price or based on how much money you are earning or losing
    Once you enter a trade, forget your cost and do what the market tells you
    If you have taken profit on a trade, don't think that I sold here just now, I need to buy lower.
    If you have cut loss on a trade, also don't think that I cut here just now, if I buy higher than my cut price I am stupid.
    Just do what is right.

# 2: Staying Positive: Don't try to earn too much too fast
    Sometimes its ok to just take a smaller percentage of a big move​.
    If you are on a 1 min time frame, maybe market can only move 50 pts in 5 mins at most, don't try to aim for 100 pts.
    Don’t be obsessed about selling at top or bottom. We want to make money, not proof that we are right.​
    Take a bit everyday then upsize, compounding effect is real!
    Trade 1 lot win 1000 times, 2 lot win 5000 times slowly upsize.
    Do the right thing a thousand times and you will naturally be confident​

# 2: Staying Positive: Focus on ourselves
    Don't compare ourselves to others​ this is the surest way to fuck us up. 
    Do not be jealous that people are earning more than us.
    Do not be jealous that other people have better resources than us
    Do not blame others when we lose money 
    It's all about us, we lose money because we are not good enough.
    We focus on ourselves, find out whats wrong, and try to improve

# 2: Staying Positive: Don't be ego and admit you are wrong
    Don't be stubborn, we are always wrong, market is always right. There is nobody to blame except ourselves. ​
    Accept it, we can be smart and still lose money. That's just the nature of markets. It does not care about our intelligence or our feelings.​
    We are followers. Not the main actors, don't try to "move the market". 
    We follow and trade based on what the market tells us. Don't be ego, don't act smart.​

# 2: Staying Positive: Accept Randomness
    We can do the right things and still be wrong quite a few times.
    Most of us have wrong concept of randomness. Try flipping a fair coin and see how many times heads can come up in a row
    Learn to do the right things, and let probability handle the rest. 
    There is randomness in markets, sometimes you can do the right thing and still lose money, but markets is not against you.​

# 2: Staying Positive: Enjoy the process
    ​If you don't enjoy the process even if you win you still lose.​ Don't end up like one of those rich grumpy people​
    If you enjoy the process, even if you lose you still win!​
    Treat trading like learning guitar, watching porn, playing a game or something you enjoy doing
        - You don't really keep comparing to ppl and get pissed that people got better graphics card than you
        - You can play the game and lose more than half the time, but still enjoy cos you had a good time with your friends
        - There are times when you lose because of luck but you let it go, you had a good time anyway..
    Try to bring these feelings back to trading and try to enjoy the process. Or its hard to last in this industry

# 2: Staying Positive: The best strategy is...
    The best strategy is patience. 
    There will ALWAYS be opportunities in the market, its ok to just wait until you are sure before entering. 
    If you are not feeling confident, just take the SUREST trades.​
    When there's no clear signal just stay out and wait, or try but take very small losses.
    Remember, between earning $1000 and losing $1000 is a $2000 difference in PNL
    In the same vein, learn to take a break, when you keep losing, pause a while and wait. Reflect, just chill and wait until you are ok before trading.
    Implement a trading halt if necassary

# 2: Staying Positive Conclusion
    Staying positive means in both monetary terms and emotional terms
    Key to doing that is to develop the right habits and the right mindset
    These things are foundation / bedrock of our trading. 
    Whenever we have trouble, in a bad patch, go back and read these principles.

# 3: Principles of trading: How to make money
    Don't lose money! There are ten thousand ways to make money. But only so few ways to lose money​
    Top 7 reasons why we lose money​

    1 Averaging down​
        - When we are averaging down, its market showing us we are wrong, why are we making the mistake again by adding more? 
        - If we are really right, then what about the guy who is on the other side? He is actually more right than us.​
    2 Not cutting loss​
        - There are opporunities everyday, just cut and move on. Don't be ego. 
        - Just like hooking up, why fuck ourselves up over one girl? Just stop talking to her, and try with other girls​
        - We will be stuck and be prevent from taking other better opporunities!​
    3 Turning a winning trade into a losing trade​
        - We are making money and market turn against us. We become stubborn don't want exit. 
        - Market come to entry price and we cannot stand seeing paper profits turn to zero.
        - End up cutting the position. ​
    4 Not having a plan (having a shit plan is better than no plan)​
        - Many times people enter a trade because of a feeling or whatever.
        - They end up staring at the chart, checking prices every 5 mins. 
        - It's not like they will do anything about it. But they just stare at the chart and pray.
        - Nothing is going on in their heads.
    5 Having a plan but not sticking to it when it comes down executing​
        - You tell yourself that market needs to reach this price before you buy
        - But market suddenly spike up, and you are afraid of missing out and you just go with the flow.
        - Its perfectly ok if this was one of your plans, but if its not, then too bad, its your fault for not factoring this in.
        - You have to give this opportunity a miss
    6 Changing our plan halfway (Espacially changing timeframe!)
        - You plan to just trade a very tight range. Market go up 10 points you exit.
        - Market ended up going down 10 points, and we say, "Oh, this is actually a long term position"
        - We end up finding excuses and changing our plan halfway just because we lose money
    7 Trading based on 1 factor
        - Market go up because of multiple factors
        - But then we are obssesed with one single factor and we ignore everything else.
        - Eg: We see good earnings and we just stubbornly believe that price can go up. But if the index is dropping like mad we need to factor that in.
    8 Doing things beyond our ability / not familiar with
        - A lot of trading principles are guidelines
        - Many succesful people average down too.
        - But we must proof to ourselves that we can do the basic things right before we try funky stuff and complex strategies
        - Also, in a new market, we have to make sure we can make money first before we upsize.

# 3: Principles of trading: Why do market go up - Money
    Money. When there is money, and people do not want to hold cash they will buy something.​
    When there is too much money chasing too few goods, markets will rise, regardless of fundamentals. ​
        - Just like when the Fed printed a lot of money. People do not want to hold cash
        - They will just go out and buy something, be it property or stocks. 
        - The fundamentals of this did not change
        - Just like if a girl suddenly strike lottery and get $1 billion, she wil buy a lot of hermes and push up the price
        - But it's not like Hermes suddenly become more quality or have better design
        - On the contrary, if now people lose their jobs, have no money to go KTV they will sell their stocks too.
    This is why volume is so important.​
    When market is rising, we need healthy volume. ​
        - Too little volume
            - There are actually not a lot of buyers, market only go up because the sellers never come out (maybe)
            - In any case, the foundation of upmove is not strong.​
                - If a property in a area normally transact at 1 million. Suddenly only 1 house transact at 1.5 million, we dont be convinced
                - However, if 5 properties start to transact at 1.5 million then we will be surer
        - Too much volume 
            - The sellers are very strong, maybe last time we need 1 million dollars to move $1, now it took $10mil to move $1. 
            - Buyers are exhausted by the time price move up $1 and there are no more buyers to push up price anymore
                - If normally only 5 property transact every month, and every year only 20 transasct.
                - Suddenly we see 100 property transact in this area, we will think things are fishy also. 
                - Everyone who want to buy already bought, if I buy already, who wil I sell to next?

# 3: Principles of trading: Why do market go up - Relay and Teamwork
    For price to move it’s a relay match. New buyers need to be willing to pick up the baton from the old buyers (turned sellers). ​
    So if you suddenly push the market up too high too fast, nobody wants to play relay and pick up the price from you when you want to exit. It's too expensive now!
    So again, healthy volume, and healthy speed is important. ​
    Finally, its teamwork! Multiple players from all sorts of background seeing different reasons (factors) come in
        - Technical analysis see chart good
        - Fundamental players see that supply demand, earnings good
        - Sentiment players / twitter bot see good news or whatever

# 3: Principles of trading: Why do market turn   
    Divergence. Mostly markets turn when there is some form of dissonant / divergence.​
    Divergence just means there is a confict, there are mixed signals. It can come in many forms
    Examples include, after a substained rally
        - Good news come out but market never break new high anymore
        - Market breaks new high but the volume is contracting or the gradient is small (no more strength)​
        - Market breaks new high and volume suddenly spikes, and prices moves too steeply
    Most of the time we just need to observe and
        - Get out if we have a position 
        - Prepare ourselves for the subsequent turns in market
    To trade the turning point, We really need to have a good gauge of price, volume and time​
    Trying to do a reversal of a trend is always difficult. ​
    Do not do try to trade this at the start of your career or when you are trading a new product​

# 3: Principles of trading: The state of markets
    At any point of time, market is either going up, going down, or sideways.​
        - This is axiomatic, there are no other forms.​
    At any point of time, market is going up, also going down, and also going sideways.​
        - It depends on the timeframe you are looking at.​
        - On a monthly chart it can be trading sideways 
        - On a dailly chart it can be going up
        - On a 5min chart it can be going down
    A big downtrend in a 5 min chart might be the retracement from a huge uptrend in the daily chart​
    However, if your timeframe is 5 min, then you should avoid buying this big downtrend, as stated in the previous slide. ​

# 3: Principles of trading: Buying the dip
    Buying the dip is not to buy into a crashing market and get run over. ​
    It is a multi-timeframe strategy.​
    It is not a counter-trend strategy. It is a trend following strategy.​
    If your trading timeframe is 5 min, then you should be buying the dip in the 1 min, during a 5min uptrend
    Hence, when there is a mini downtrend in the 1 min chart, you can choose to buy the dip, knowing that you have a bigger trend in your favor.​
    However, if you are wrong, then you should just cut loss. ​

# 3: Principles of trading: Buying a rally
    Buying the rally is tricky because of fake breakouts.​
    Can be very profitable but extremely willing to cut when false breakout. 
    A real breakout has very strong momentum, or rather, we only want to trade a breakout with very strong momentum.
    Usually a breakout must be confirmed with high volume, compare to the past few candles.​
    We should try to give up on those wishy washy breakouts.​
    Very possible that after you buy a breakout, it will trade down and squeeze you out before shooting up again. 
    But you just have to accept it cut, and rebuy, or if not, learn to buy the squeeze after the breakout.​
    Must be very willing to take profit when market turns after the rally. ​
    Lastly, its a multiple timeframe issue again, we can buy a mini dip during a breakout also. 

# 3: Principles of trading: Critical Points
    At the start, make sure all the trades you make fall into one of these "critical points"​
    Points that let market "come to you". In these cases the cut point is clear, cos will be the previous low region.
        1: The dangerous turning point of a big trend
            - Try to avoid because need to have very good judge of momentum, price, volume, time.
            - "Normally", the trend will not have just 1 wave, there needs to be at least 2 or 3 waves before it ends
        2: The retest of the low of after a big trend (akin to double btm / double top)​
        3a: The dip of a rally (retracement of a big trend)​. A trend has formed on 5 min, but you buy dip on 1 min
        3b: The dip after it breakout and form a new high
        4: The low of a prolonged sideway market 
    ​Points that you cross the market so to speak
        5a: Breakout of a new high during a trend​
        5b: Breakout of a sideway market
        5c: Breakout of the sideway market during the uptrend (same as B actually just timeframe issue)​
    We can always find one of these points, depending on the timeframe. 
    Even if a chart is showing consecutive big green bars, there will still be chances to "buy the dip" if you move into a lower timeframe.​

# 3: Principles of trading: Averaging up and getting out
    Averaging up
        - If we have bought the first wave, we can consider buying the second wave again
        - If we have bought the second wave, maybe we should really reconsider buying the third wave
        - When to not average up:
            - Volatility of the market is 100 points (you are trading 5 min time frame, and it can move 100 points in 5 - 10 mins)
            - The wave you judge can at most move up, 200 points then theres no point average up because the volatility can wipe you out.
    Getting out
        - price breaks the previous low significantly then we should get out.
        - price starts moving sideways and wishy washy then we should get out (our judgement of trend is wrong)
        - price rallys and pauses and starts trading sideways then we should be looking to get out
